# Theory of Algorithms
These notes were compiled during my Computer Science course at the University of Cape Town. It is a general summary of the slides, lectures and any other content that I deemed useful. 

Hence, these notes were taken & adapted from slides and lectures created by the following people
* Sonia Berman
* James Gain
* Nathan Geffen

Here are summaries of slides:
* [Introduction](TOA1.md)

The books used for this course are:
* [Introduction to the Design & Analysis of Algorithms]()
* [Algorithms](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms.html)
* [Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in Java](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/Book/)
* [Art of Computer Programming]()
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
