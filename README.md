# Theory of Algorithms
These notes were compiled during my Computer Science course at the University of Cape Town. It is a general summary of the slides, lectures and any other content that I deemed useful. 

Hence, these notes were taken & adapted from slides and lectures created by the following people: 
* [Sonia Berman](http://www.hpi.cs.uct.ac.za/sonia)
* [James Gain](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~jgain/)
* [Nathan Geffen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Geffen)

Here are summaries of slides :eyeglasses:
* [Introduction](TOA1.md)
* [Algorithm Efficiency](TOA2.md)
* [Brute Force](TOA3.md)

The [pracs üìÅ](pracs) has information about the different practicals.
