# Practicals
This folder contains practicals from multiple sources. A large majority of these practicals are from within the Computer Science department at UCT. They are in no way mine. They were created by the following people:
* [Stephan Jamieson](https://www.cs.uct.ac.za/staff)
* [Sonia Berman](http://www.hpi.cs.uct.ac.za/sonia)

There are two folders within this repository the *Course* folder and the *Others* folder. The [Course üìÅ](Course) refers to the practicals that were given to us during the course in 2018 and the [Others üìÅ](Others) refers to the other practicals that I worked through.

I added the tables below in order to easily visualize how all the practicals are going. If you have completed a practical in a different way(perhaps more efficient, or in a different language üòé)  please add it to the repository!
