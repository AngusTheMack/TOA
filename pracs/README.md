# Practicals
Here are the practicals I can find. There are two folders within this repository the *Course* folder and the *Others* folder. The [Course 📁](Course) refers to the practicals that were given to us during the course in 2018 and the [Others 📁](Others) refers to the other practicals that I could find/I received - which were largely the same ones, just in a different format.

I added the tables below in order to easily visualize how all the practicals are going. If you have completed a practical in a different way(perhaps more efficient, or in a different language 😎)  please add it to the repository!
